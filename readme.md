# 1inch Fusion+ Cross-Chain Extension: ETH ↔ NEAR

## 🎯 Implementation Summary

This project implements a **novel extension for 1inch Cross-chain Swap (Fusion+)** that enables bidirectional atomic swaps between Ethereum and NEAR Protocol, following the official 1inch architecture and using battle-tested contracts.

## ✅ Requirements Fulfilled

### Core Requirements
- ✅ **Bidirectional Swaps**: ETH ↔ NEAR swaps in both directions
- ✅ **Hashlock/Timelock Preservation**: SHA256 + timestamp for non-EVM (NEAR)
- ✅ **Onchain Execution**: Production-ready smart contracts
- ✅ **1inch Infrastructure**: Uses official EscrowFactory at `0xa7bcb4eac8964306f9e3764f67db6a7af6ddf99a`

### Key Features
- **Official 1inch Integration**: Built on proven cross-chain-swap infrastructure
- **Authorized Resolver System**: Secure cross-chain execution
- **Emergency Recovery**: Owner-controlled safety mechanisms
- **Atomic Guarantees**: Success or complete reversion

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Ethereum Side
```solidity
InchCrossChainResolver.sol
├── Uses official 1inch EscrowFactory (0xa7bcb4...)
├── Creates EscrowSrc contracts for ETH → NEAR
├── Manages cross-chain swap coordination
└── Implements resolver authorization system
```

### NEAR Side
```rust
lib.rs (enhanced HTLC)
├── Cross-chain HTLC creation
├── SHA256 hashlock verification
├── Timelock enforcement
└── Atomic completion/refund
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Deploy Contracts
```bash
# Deploy Ethereum resolver
cd eth-contracts
forge script script/DeployInchHTLC.s.sol:DeployInchCrossChainResolver --broadcast

# Deploy NEAR contract
cd near-contracts
./build.sh && ./deploy.sh <account-id>
```

### 2. Test Cross-Chain Swap

#### ETH → NEAR
```javascript
// 1. Create escrow using 1inch factory
const immutables = {
    token: tokenAddress,
    amount: ethers.utils.parseEther("1"),
    hashlock: sha256(secret),
    // ... other fields
};

const swapId = await resolver.createETHToNEARSwap(immutables, "user.near");

// 2. Complete on NEAR
await nearContract.complete_cross_chain_swap({
    contract_id: swapId,
    preimage: Array.from(secret),
    eth_tx_hash: "0x..."
});
```

#### NEAR → ETH
```javascript
// 1. Create NEAR HTLC
const contractId = await nearContract.create_cross_chain_htlc({
    receiver: "resolver.near",
    hashlock: Array.from(hashlock),
    timelock: Date.now() + 86400000,
    eth_address: "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b8D2DC"
});

// 2. Complete on Ethereum
await resolver.completeSwap(swapId, secret, immutables);
```

## 🔒 Security Features

### 1inch Battle-Tested Infrastructure
- **EscrowFactory**: Uses official 1inch deployed contracts
- **Immutables Verification**: Ensures swap integrity
- **Timelock Protection**: 24-hour default expiration

### Atomic Guarantees
- **Same Hashlock**: Both chains use identical SHA256 hash
- **Coordinated Timelock**: Prevents partial completion
- **Emergency Recovery**: Owner can rescue stuck funds after 7 days

### Authorization System
- **Resolver Authorization**: Only authorized resolvers can execute
- **Owner Controls**: Emergency functions protected
- **Event Logging**: Full audit trail

## 📊 Testing

### Ethereum Tests
```bash
cd eth-contracts
forge test -vv

# Test specific scenarios
forge test --match-test testAuthorizeResolver
forge test --match-test testRegisterNEARSwap
```

### NEAR Tests
```bash
cd near-contracts/htlc-near
cargo test

# Test cross-chain functionality
cargo test test_cross_chain_htlc
```

## 🌐 Deployment Addresses

### Ethereum Mainnet/Testnets

## 📋 Integration Guide

### For Developers
1. **Import Interfaces**: Use provided contract interfaces
2. **Authorize Resolvers**: Register trusted resolver addresses
3. **Monitor Events**: Listen for swap initiation/completion
4. **Handle Errors**: Implement proper error handling for timeouts

### For Resolvers
1. **Register**: Get authorized by contract owner
2. **Monitor**: Watch for cross-chain swap events
3. **Execute**: Coordinate between Ethereum and NEAR
4. **Verify**: Ensure atomic completion or reversion
